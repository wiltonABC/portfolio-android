    <string name="app_about">This app was made as part of my personal portfolio solution.
The purpose is to provide potential employers another way to see my professional profile and show off some of my mobile software development skills.
\n\n
As the web frontend and web backend, this software source code is available on my github.
\n\n
The main goal of the entire portfolio solution is to portray a bit of my work experience through a software solution entirely designed by me, since I have always worked with proprietary software, of which I can not give much detail.</string>
